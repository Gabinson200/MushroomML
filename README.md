# MushroomML
This project aims to build a lightweight image classification system that recognizes a small set of common mushroom species from camera images in real time and deploy it on a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3 board with a connected camera. The system will classify mushrooms into a small number of species and output an “unknown” label when uncertain.
